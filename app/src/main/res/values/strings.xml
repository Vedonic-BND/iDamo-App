    <!-- Disease description and solution -->
    <!-- Downy Mildew Disease -->
    <string name="downyMildewDiseaseTitle">Downey Mildew</string>
    <string name="downyMildewDiseaseDescription">\t\tA type of oomycetes or water mold, downy mildew causes the growth of gray or white, as well as the yellowing and wilting of leaves. A harmful pathogen that develops on the underside of leaves that can cover the entire leaf and causes it to turn brown and dry up.
        \n\n\t\tHeavy infection of downy mildew can devastate a crop and kill most of the plants within a week. It can spread everywhere stopping the plant from photosynthesizing on these yellow or brown spots.
    </string>
    <string name="downyMildewDiseaseSymptoms">\t\tDowny mildew causes light green to yellow spots found on the upper surface of leaves and hemmed in by the leaf veins. Sporulation or downy fuzz can also be seen on the underside of the leaf when the weather is wet or humid.
    \n\n\t\tDamp, cool conditions and moisture on leaves causes the disease to arise and can lead to stunted growth and reduced yields. Downy mildews are air water borne pathogens and can spread progressively if left unattended.
    </string>
    <string name="downyMildewDiseaseSolution">\t\tThe following guideline are for the treatment and prevention of Downy Mildew.
    \n\n\n<b><font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">Prevention:</font></b>
    \n\n⦿ Trim and dispose infected areas immediately.
    \n\n⦿ Prune or stake plants and remove any weeds to improve air circulation.
    \n\n⦿ Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.
    \n\n⦿ Always dispose of fallen leaves to prevent the disease from spreading.
    \n\n\n<b><font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">Remedies:</font></b>
    \n\nA. Dairy Milk Solution
    \n\n\t1. Combine 1-part diary milk to 2-parts water in a spray bottle.
    \n\n\t2. Spray the leaves once each week.
    \n\n\t <font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">* <i>Non-Diary milk substitutes won’t work.</i></font>
    \n\n\nB. Baking Soda Solution:
    \n\n\t1. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda, 2.5 tablespoon of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of liquid soap, and 1 gallon of water in a spray bottle.
    \n\n\t2. Spray a small test area with the solution before spraying the entire plant.
    \n\n\t3. If burning if absent spray the leaves once every two weeks.
    \n\n\t <font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">* <i>Use liquid soap, not detergent.</i></font>
    \n\n\nC. Neem Oil:
    \n\n\t1. Spray the leaves with neem oil once every two weeks.
    \n\n\nD. Fungicides:
    \n\n\t1. Use organic fungicides as a last resort, follow directions regarding application.
    \n\n\t2. Apply fungicide early to prevent outbreaks.

    <!-- Leaf Scars / Black Spots Disease -->
    <string name="scarsSpotsDiseaseTitle">Leaf Scars / Black Spots</string>
    <string name="scarsSpotsDiseaseDescription">\t\tA round, black spot with fringed margins that grows up to ½ inch in diameter are caused by a fungus. This disease is found on flowers, fruits, and leaves, it commonly affects roses and other ornamental and garden plants.
        \n\n\t\tThe spots weaken the plant causing stress that may interrupt photosynthesis. These spots develop only on the upper surface of the leaves and the surrounding area turns yellow.
    </string>
    <string name="scarsSpotsDiseaseSymptoms">\t\tBlack spots come in different form of dark, round leaf spots with irregular feathered margins. The spots form a yellow edge or ‘halo’ around the infected area of the leaf that can expand and cover the entire leaf.
    \n\n\t\tThe lowest parts of the plants are mostly infected first and can worsen overtime when left unchecked. Usually, black spots may arise when the weather is hot and humid, and leaves are moist for at least 6 hours.
    </string>
    <string name="scarsSpotsDiseaseSolution">\t\tThe following guideline are for the treatment and prevention of Leaf Scar/Black Spots.
    \n\n\n<b><font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">Prevention:</font></b>
    \n\n⦿ Trim and dispose infected areas immediately.
    \n\n⦿ Prune and remove weeds to improve air circulation.
    \n\n⦿ Do not overcrowd plants.
    \n\n⦿ Avoid overhead watering. Water the base of the plant rather than the foliage, it prevents the spread of diseases and fungal growth on the plant.
    \n\n⦿ Use drip irrigation or low volume sprinklers.
    \n\n\n<b><font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">Remedies:</font></b>
    \n\n\nA. Baking Soda Solution:
    \n\n\t1. Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of liquid soap and 1 gallon of water in a spray bottle.
    \n\n\t2. Gently spray the solution on both top and bottom part of the leaves.
    \n\n\t3. Spray once for three to four weeks.
    \n\n\t <font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">* <i>Use liquid soap, not detergent.</i></font>
    \n\n\nB. Milk Solution:
    \n\n\t1. Mix 1 part milk to 2 – 3 parts water in a spray bottle.
    \n\n\t2. Gently spray the solution on both top and bottom part of the leaves.
    \n\n\t3. Spray once for three to four weeks.

    <!-- Shot Hole Disease -->
    <string name="shotHoleDiseaseTitle">Shot Hole</string>
    <string name="shotHoleDiseaseDescription">\t\tCoryneum Blight commonly known as Shot Hole is caused by a fungal pathogen Wilsonomyces Carpophilus. It often affects fruits, buds, and stems, but is most obvious on the leaves. Fruit bearing trees from the genus of Prunus such as peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, and nectarines are common to shot hole disease.
        \n\n\t\tWet and humid weather contributes to the spread of shot hole disease. Inadequate growing circumstances, environmental stress, and insects consuming foliage are just a few of the causes of the holes appearing in leaves.
    </string>
    <string name="shotHoleDiseaseSymptoms">\t\tShot hole first appear as purple or red spots that shortly expands and turn into brown patches that eventually falls off, leaving multiple round holes on the leaf. Each hole frequently has a thin yellow or brown ring surrounding the hole. The fungal disease also causes premature leaf drops and scabby lesions on the leaf.
        \n\n\t\tThe fungal spores spreads in splashing water, and common during warm, foggy, or rainy weather. Shot hole is most severe during mid to late summer where weather tends to be wet and humid.

    <string name="shotHoleDiseaseSolution">\t\t<b>The following guideline are for the treatment and prevention of Shot Hole.</b>
    \n\n\n<b><font fgcolor="#FFFFFF">Prevention:</font></b>

    \n\n⦿ Use drip irrigation or low volume sprinklers.
    \n\n⦿ Promptly trim off infected leaves but avoid heavy pruning to prevent stress on plants.

    <!-- Healthy Leaf Disease -->
    <string name="healthyLeafTitle">Healthy Leaf</string>
    <string name="healthyLeafDescription">\t\tWhile it might be stating the obvious, it’s crucially important to understand what your plants’ leaves should look like so you’re better able to observe when things go amiss. And while all plant have different growth patterns and characteristics, healthy leaves usually have:
    \n\n\t• Vigorous Growth
    \n\n\t• Uniform Color (unless they are naturally variegated)
    \n\n\t• Open, rather than curled, growth
    \n\n\t• Upright Appearance
    \n\n\n<font fgcolor="#00FFFF"><b>Tip:</b> </font><i>Remember to look at the underside of your plants\’ leaves as well — many damaging insects hide in those hard-to-see places.</i>
    </string>
    <string name="healthyLeafDiseaseSolution">\t\tFollow these steps to keep your plants healthy:
    \n\n1. Plant in a fertile, permeable, loamy, and right pH soil to build a strong and healthy plant.
    \n\n2. Water deeply. Give your ornaments a deep soak once a week. It is also a good idea to water in the morning, as this will prevent evaporation. Take note that some ornamentals like the soil a little dry; so, refrain from over-watering.
    \n\n3. You can use stakes to support taller ornamentals and keep them safe from strong winds. Note that a lot of perennials and annuals can become brittle after heavy rains. So stabilizing is extremely important.
    \n\n4. Maintain the shape of your ornamental plants and remove diseased or dead branches. To increase air circulation and encourage new growth, you can give your plants some trimming.
    \n\n5. Make sure you mulch your soil beds every year. Mulch can provide root insulation for plants during the extreme summer heat. Mulch will also help to prevent weed growth. It will also retain moisture in the soil.
    \n\n6. Keep weeds out. Like all other plants, ornamentals too need sun for their healthy growth. Although mulching is a good way to keep weeds away from your ornamental beds, there are other options too. These include landscape fabric, ornamental bedding treatments, and hand pulling of weeds.
    \n\n7. Do not overcrowd your plants. Proper spacing can provide proper air circulation around plants. Choosing the right pot for container gardening must also be considered.
